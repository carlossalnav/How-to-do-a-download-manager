important!

1. First if you want to order a specific folder you can do it just modifying the "downloadPath" variable to the new path:
	For example:
		Old folder path: "/Users/Mario/Downloads/"
		New folder path: "/Users/Mario/Desktop/MyFiles/"
	IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO RESPECT THE FORMAT ALL THE TIME.

2. It is probably that you want to organize the files in other way even if they are of different type so:
	You must go to the variable of extensions and modify it:
		For example:
			I DON'T WANT: videoExt or audioExt
			I WANT: mediaExt because i edit videos and i need to search for media fast.
		And you are free of what type of extension you will use.

3. Just a simple function that gives you the option to create the folders (in case that you don't have it).

4. Function that check if you have the folders created.
	Also here in the "necessary" var, you can modify the name of your folders.
		For example:
			I DON'T WANT: Video and Audio Folders.
			I WANT: Media Folder.

5. This function order your files of your FOLDER PATH using the extentions and the folders that you create.
	For example:
		I DON'T WANT:
			for ext in videoExt:
       				if extention == ext:
            					shutil.move(downloadPath + file, downloadPath + 'Video')
    			for ext in audioExt:
        			if extention == ext:
            				shutil.move(downloadPath + file, downloadPath + 'Audio')
	Because i want a media folder with media extensions so:
		I WANT:
			for ext in mediaExt:
       				if extention == ext:
            					shutil.move(downloadPath + file, downloadPath + 'Media')

6. This function here executes all in order, but here i added a counter to know how many files are ordered when the program finishes (it isn't the most brilliant solution but it works.
	To make this counter work just enter the number of folders that you created as a integer.
		For example:
			If i create the folders "Media" and "Others":
				print('{} Files ordered successfully in {}!\n'.format(counter - 2,downloadPath))
			If i create 7 folders:
				print('{} Files ordered successfully in {}!\n'.format(counter - 7, downloadPath))
